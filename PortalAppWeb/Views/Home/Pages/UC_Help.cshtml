To access a data source you need a query type application such as SQL, Excel, Power Pivot, or Tableau to manipulate the data and create an analysis.

                <h4 class="text-help1">FAQs: Search Results</h4>

                    <li>
                        <a class="question1" href="javascript:;">How are my search results sorted? [<span class="sign-plus">+</span><span class="sign-minus">-</span>]</a><div>
                            "Relevance" is determined according to the following criteria and prioritized as follows:
                            <br /><br /><ol>
                                <li>
                                    First, the search engine looks for the key word or phrase in the title and in the description of the report/dashboard or term. The search includes logic to understand both misspelled and partial words.<br /><br />
                                    <i>Note:</i> That is why if you search for "data" you will find results that include "date". The engine compensates for a potentially misspelled word.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Second, the search engine prioritizes according to the source of the information, as follows:
                                    <br /><br /><ol type="a">
                                        <li>Terms and definitions</li>
                                        <li>Reports and dashboards</li>
                                        <li>Raw data sources.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Last, relevance is modified based on how many views the result has had in the Citrix Data Marketplace, or at the source if available.<br /><br />
                                    For example, if a Tableau report has been opened by many users, it is considered to be more relevant than another report that has had very few users.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            Searches can be refined by Category and Document Type.
                            <br />
                            There are three Categories:

                            </ul>
                            There are nine Document Types:
                            <br /><br /><table>

                            <br /><br />
                            The number of results is listed next to each Category and Document Type and the total number of results appears at the top.
